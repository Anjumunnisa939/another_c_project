printf("sana,sabha,sara,saniya,anjum,zebha misbha,anusha,vishnu,nairah");
//we get same in horizontally
//but we need line wise or vetically 
//after every name use \n which make enter button or end that line starts from another line
printf("\nsana\nsabha\nsara\nsaniya\nanjum\nzebha misbha\nanusha\nvishnu\nnairah");
